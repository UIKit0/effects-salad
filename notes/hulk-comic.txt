Picture-in-picture (comic-panel) effect:

    - Make a new Effect called Panel (Portal, PiP, whatever)

    Init:
        - Construct a new DemoContext
        - Setup the viewport on the demo context
        - Copy the DrawableList from the current context
            - if new geometry is desired, this isn't necessary

    Update:
        - Save the current context pointer (DemoContext::GetCurrent())
        - Set the current context (DemoContext::SetCurrent(...))
        - Call context->Update()
        - Restore the old context pointer
    
    Draw:
        - Same as update, but call Draw()


In the main program, add this new Panel effect to the current context's drawable list
