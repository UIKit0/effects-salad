from prideout:
 I think it would be cool to have two viewports that slide around, like in Ang Lee's "Hulk".  
 Maybe one viewport shows an industrial world with straight lines and gray tones, the other 
 shows an organic world with soft growing shapes and varying hues.  The music could leverage 
 this too.

Picture-in-picture (comic-panel) effect:

    - Make a new Effect called Panel (Portal, PiP, whatever)

    Init:
        - Construct a new DemoContext
        - Setup the viewport on the demo context
        - Copy the DrawableList from the current context
            - if new geometry is desired, this isn't necessary

    Update:
        - Save the current context pointer (DemoContext::GetCurrent())
        - Set the current context (DemoContext::SetCurrent(...))
        - Call context->Update()
        - Restore the old context pointer
    
    Draw:
        - Same as update, but call Draw()


In the main program, add this new Panel effect to the current context's drawable list
