// Our demo is 2 minutes, composed of 10 shots, each of which can be uniquely identified
// with a human-readable id string  For example: 'GrassIntro', 'KidReveal', and 'Credits'.
//
// To aid development, every shot begins with its internal clock set to "0" and has no dependencies
// on previous shots.  Scrubbing to a specific time within a shot requires it to be replayed up to
// the desired point using a sequence of "Update" calls with reasonable delta-T values.  Note that
// calling "Draw" does not update state.  Our demo is almost equivalent to running 10 different
// executables in series.
//
// A specific shot can be played using a command line argument.  eg, "salad KidReveal" will play
// the KidReveal shot, then exit.  Typing "salad" alone will play the demo until the end, then pause
// when reaching the last frame, waiting for a keypress.
//
// In the JSON specification, the duration of each shot is expressed with an absolute time in seconds.
// Shots do not have explicitly-specified start times because they always occur in sequence.
//
// Each effect within a shot has a specified start time and an optional duration.  If omitted,
// the duration is assumed to be the entire remainder of the shot. Start times are always relative
// to the start of the shot.
//
// Effect types have human-readable id strings but individual instances of effects do not have names.
//
// Each shot has an associated "camera curve id".  Curves are defined in a separate JSON file;
// each curve has a unique human-readable identifier.  Curves have positions and optional
// orientation vectors.
//
// Each shot is defined in JSON using an array with 4 elements:
//   string shotId
//   float duration
//   string cameraCurveId
//   array effects
//
// Each element in the effect array is an array with 2 to 5 elements:
//   string effectIds
//   string animationId (optional)
//   float startTime
//   float duration (optional)
//   dictionary args  (optional)
//
// The effectIds string is a space-separated list of effect types. The "args" dictionary
// is passed to all effects in this list.  Effects should silently ignore any arguments
// they do not understand.
//
// Internally, we pass around Json::Value objects for effect args instead of a special
// dictionary type like TfDictionary or map<string,boost::variant>.
//
// Low-level shader configuration (uniforms and program strings) should not be specified directly
// in the effect arguments dictionary.  A separate JSON file called "programs.json" has a mapping
// of effect ids to uniforms and program strings.
//
// Additionally, a separate JSON file called "animation.json" can be used to specify interpolation
// over time of effect arguments and/or uniform values.  The optional "animationId" string
// chooses a particular interpolation timeline from the animation JSON file.
